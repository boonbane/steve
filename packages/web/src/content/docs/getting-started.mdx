title: The Zen of Steve
---
Steve is just a guy. Well, he's an opaque blob of somewhere between 30,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000,000 floating point numbers of unclear precision. We anthropomorphized the blob, to make it feel less creepy. And, ah...

Hm. Let's start over. Steve is:
- A local AI assistant, which runs on your computer
- Accessible remotely via an end-to-end encrypted relay
- Agentic; like Claude Code for your life
- Linked to the AI subscription you already pay for
- Zero configuration or deployment. Sign up and go.

On top of that, Steve is secure by default! Not only is he inaccessible outside of your trusted devices, but he's:
- Sandboxed at the kernel level; if you don't explicitly allow it, Steve can't read it
- Built around the [lethal trifecta](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/); Steve won't leak your data because Steve *can't* leak your data
- Scoped. Every [`Task`](/task) you give Steve says what he can read, write, and fetch

Steve does *not* ingest arbitrary, untrusted content from other Steves in the same context window as holds your credit card number.

The next section expands on these traits. If you're already sold, head over to [installation](/install). If you think this is just AI slop, I urge you to return to more pressing matters.

## What is Steve?

Steve is an AI assistant. Many, who are at risk of great profit if believed, would tell you that means Steve is borderline omnipotent.

This is untrue. Steve doesn't have to take your job to change your life. All Steve has to do is book your flights, and manage your calendar, and remind you to text old friends, and tell you what you got your nephew for his birthday last year, and clean your inbox, and turn off your kitchen lights, and transcribe your voice recordings, and...


You don't need to set up Tailscale, or a tunnel service, or expose your computer to the nasty world of the internet. Steve does it for you.


### He's Local
He's local, which means he's just a program that runs on your computer.

Welcome. Come on in and get to know Steve. He's an AI assistant that runs locally, on your computer, not in the Cloud[^1]

AI is grift and gilt, a magnet for suckers and the sucked, and the worst part is that it's so useful.
